### Description

This program creates lots of 'ants'. These creatures follow certain rules, when eating, multiplying and dying. They also get eaten by 'ant eaters'. Ant statistics are shown on screen. The ants are the white dots and the eaters are the purple dots. The green dots is food for the ants.

I have updated this program on the 6/11/2001 mainly from input by a programmer called Pei Pei. This update could not have been possible without her. There is some new and updated behavour for the ants and ant eaters and the code has been debugged and some setions re-commented for better understanding of the code.

Let me know what you think and don't be afraid to email me,

Eric
